// Q.1 Create the Example for Logical Operators. 
	// Logical Operators (&&, ||, !), it is binary operator which require two operants. We can use it in 
	// Comparison Operators
    // Examole:
	// let a = 5;
	// let b = 7;
	// let c = 10;
	// console.log(`a is smallest among these: ${a<b && b<c}`);
    //  output: true

// Q.2	Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators.

    // The == operator is an equality operator. It checks whether its two operands are the same or not by changing expression from one data type
    // to others. You can use == operator in order to compare the identity of two operands even though, they are not of a similar type.

    //  “ === “ is Strict equality === checks that two values are the same or not.
    //  Value are not implicitly converted to some other value before comparison.
    //  If the variable values are of different types, then the values are considered as unequal.
    //  If the variable are of the same type, are not numeric, and have the same value, they are considered as equal.
    //  Lastly, If both variable values are numbers, they are considered equal if both are not NaN (Not a Number) and are the same value.

    //  let num = 22;
    //  let str = "22";
    //  console.log(`Both are same: ${num == str}`); 
    //  output: true
    
    //  console.log(`Both are same: ${num === str}`);
    //  output: false


// Q.3 How many operators do we have in JS ?
    // 	There are so many operators in js
    // 	1: Assignment Operators
    // 	2: Arithmetic Operators
    // 	3: Comparison Operators
    // 	4: Logical Operators
    // 	5: Bitwise Operators
    // 	6:Ternary Operators

// Q.4 What is use of parseInt in js?
    // 	parseInt is a method to convert string value into number.
    // 	let str = "123";
    // 	typeof(str);
    //  output: string

    // 	let num = parseInt(str);
    // 	typeof(num);
    //  output: number

// Q.5 Take input from user and find the odd and even number.

    // 	let a = parseInt(prompt("Enter Your Number"));
	
    // 	if(a%2==0){
    // 		console.log(`${a} is even`)
    // 	}
    // 	else{
    // 		console.log(`${a} is odd`)
    // 	}
